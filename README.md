# BeloteRE

BeloteRE is a very simple belote game. It's goal is to provide belote gamers
with a very simple and easy way to play solo without having to create an account
or anything else.

This game also aims to free up people from spying platforms using patterns that
try to make people addict to their app.

With BeloteRE, you're in control of when and how you want to play with probably
the lowest environnemental impact you could find (no ads, no tracking, no
permnanent connection...).
